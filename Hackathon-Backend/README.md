# Cognizant Outreach Green Star Application

		The Green Start Application helps to address three major problems of school. 
Attendance - Schools have poor attendance and no strict attendance tracking mechanisms, resulting in higher dropout rates.

Homework - Majority of students in govt. schools do not have a formal homework structure which discourages them to learn at home.

Discipline - No focus provided on behavioral changes as most of the items are provided by the govt.These problems are transferred into measurable parameters and stars are warded.
